# Bangla Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten Bangla digits (0–9) from images. It is an academic internship project aimed at applying deep learning techniques to a real-world handwritten character recognition problem.

The system can classify Bangla digits from test images with high accuracy and visualize predictions with confidence scores.

## Features
- Preprocesses images: grayscale conversion, resizing (28x28), normalization.
- CNN architecture for robust digit classification.
- Training and validation with high accuracy (~99% training, ~95–96% validation).
- Prediction on unseen test images with confidence scores.
- Visualizations of predictions and misclassified images.
